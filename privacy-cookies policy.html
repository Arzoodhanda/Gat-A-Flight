                On many of the pages of the site you will see 'social buttons'. These enable users to share or
                 bookmark the web pages. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant
                  social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside. You should be aware
                   that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around
                    the internet. So if you click on any of these buttons, these sites will be registering that
                     action and may use that information. In some cases these sites will be registering the fact
                      that you are visiting our site and the specific pages you are on, even if you don't click on
                       the button if you are logged into their services, like Google and Facebook. You should check
                        the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information
                         and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.

                usage of this embedded content. If you are not logged in to these external services then they will not
