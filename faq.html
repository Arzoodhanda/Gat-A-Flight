            <h6>
                <strong>What travel documents do I need and when will I receive them?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Passengers require documents pertaining to every service that they have booked with us.
                 Documentation for your flights, car hire bookings, invoices, e-tickets, insurance, hotel vouchers etc.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>How long before my departure do I need to check-in?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Please check in as per the following requirement: International flights - Check-in at least 3 hours
                 prior to departure. European flights - Check-in at least 2 hours prior to departure. Domestic
                  flights - Check-in at least 1 hours prior to departure. Please note that boarding begins 45
                   minutes prior to departure. Getaflight does not hold any liability whatsoever in case you
                    arrive at the airport later than your specified time and are unable to travel.
            </p>
            <h6>
                <strong>Which terminal is my flight departing from?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Your e-ticket or the itinerary sent along with your paper ticket (if applicable) will have the
                 information about the departure terminal of your flight. You may also contact us at 020 7725 7000
                  if you are unsure of the information.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>What is my baggage allowance?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
               Airlines use two free checked baggage allowance systems; a weight allowance based on airline and class of travel and a piece system of 23kg per bag. Where airline tickets and holiday documentation have been provided by Getaflight they will show which baggage allowance system applies and details of the permitted weight allowance. **If your outward flight from the UK is on the piece system and you have onward connections with other carriers to various destinations, your baggage allowance may then be restricted by the weight system.** Please note domestic flights in the UK are governed by the weight system and not the piece system even if you connect onto a flight that uses the piece system. Please refer to your airline ticket for the correct baggage allowance. We recommend you clarify all baggage procedures with the airport check-in staff.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>Will my baggage allowance be the same on internal flights within my destination?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                If your internal flights involve travel by light aircraft or seaplane generally your luggage allowance will be less than on your international flights. Please check with your Travel Consultant at the time of booking to see if any restrictions may apply to your flights.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>Will there be any restrictions on my hand baggage?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                We advise you to check the BAA website before you travel for the latest hand baggage restrictions and liquid exemptions on www.baa.com. Some airlines may differ as to the weight and number of hand baggage pieces allowed but each bag must be no larger than 56cm tall, 45cm wide and 25cm deep.<br><br>

                All liquids must be in individual containers no greater than 100ml capacity and carried in a transparent re-sealable bag such as a 'ziplock' bag and no larger than 20cm x 20cm (8" x 8") in size. Liquids in containers of more than 100ml should be packed in your checked baggage as they will not be permitted in your hand baggage.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>How do I reserve a specific seat on my flight?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                The majority of airlines have a limited number of seats available for advance seating. How to reserve your flight seats varies from airline to airline and some airlines do make a charge to reserve specific seat numbers in advance of your departure date. If you require assistance with reserving seats with your airline, please contact your Personal Travel Consultant. Get A Flight will do everything possible to meet your seat requests however no guarantee can be given.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>How can I book a seat with extra legroom?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Exit seats can only be allocated on the day of departure by check in staff to passengers over the age of 16 who are physically fit and most airlines reserve bulkhead seats for clients requiring a sky cot for infants. We therefore recommend that our clients arrive for check in 3 hours prior to departure.
            </p>
            <h6>
                <strong>Can I make a meal request on my flight?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                We are more than happy to pass on special dietary requirements to Airlines on your behalf. Please note that we require notice at least 48 hours before your departure date to arrange a special meal with an Airline. To request a special meal please mention your requirement to your Travel Consultant at the time of booking.
            </p>

            <h6>
                <strong>Will I need a Visa or Transit Visa for my trip?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Below are some visa requirements for passengers holding EU passports ONLY. Clients with a non-EU passport should seek advice from the embassy for the country that they will be visiting. It is the responsibility of all passengers to ensure that they have the relevant documents to enter any destination featured in the itinerary. USA - If travelling to the USA you will require an ESTA visa that can be found through a link provided with your invoice: esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/. If you have a criminal conviction within the UK, you will need to contact the USA embassy directly to arrange a visa: 020 7499 9000 Cuba - If travelling to Cuba, you will require a Cuban Visa, which can be purchased from the Cuban Embassy at a cost of £15. Vietnam- For customers travelling to Vietnam for a stay longer than 15 days, a visa is required before you travel and can be purchased through the embassy: vietnamembassy.org.uk. If your stay is for less than 15 days, and you have a UK, Spanish or Italian passport then no visa is required. Note: Please be careful when calculating the time spent in Vietnam as no extension to the visa waiver can be obtained in Vietnam. Sri Lanka - Sri Lanka travellers can obtain a visa on arrival, however we advise to purchase one before travel through: eta.gov.lk/slvisa/ India - You’ll need to get a visa before travelling to India. You can find further information about how to apply on the Indian High Commission website. Holders of passports endorsed ‘British citizen’ who meet the eligibility criteria can apply for an e-Tourist Visa (e-TV) to enter India at certain designated airports. You can find more information about the eligibility criteria on the government of India’s e-Tourist Visa website. Mauritius - Passengers travelling to Mauritius do not need to obtain a visa before arrival. A tourist visa, normally valid for 60 days, will be issued on arrival to holders of valid British passports in possession of return tickets. You must ensure that you have at least one completely blank page in your passport, which is an entry requirement. Maldives - For customers travelling to The Maldives a tourist visa is issued free of charge on arrival for up to 30 days provided they hold a valid ticket to continue their journey out of The Maldives. Bali - When arriving into Bali, passengers are required to purchase a visa in US Dollars. A British citizen visiting Bali can buy a 30-day visa-on-arrival at a cost of US $35. Dominican Republic - Tourists entering Dominican Republic must purchase a Tourist Card upon arrival at a cost of 10USD per person, including children and infants. The card may also be obtained before you go on at the following website: https://www.dgii.gov.do/Tturistaweb/home For all other destinations please check the embassy website for the country you will be visiting.
            </p>

                <strong>How long is an ESTA valid for?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                An ESTA visa is valid for two years from the purchase date. However it needs to be updated each time you travel to the USA.
            </p>
            <h6>
                <strong>Can I change or amend my booking?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                You may contact our Amendments department / customer care department on 020 7725 7000 to make an amendment to your flight or hotel booking. All flight or hotel bookings are amended at applicable fees subject to the contract of the fare purchased and consequently not all bookings can be amended. Unfortunately, it is not possible to make amendments to car hire reservations. This is classed as a Cancellation.
            </p>
            <h6>
                <strong>What happens if I wish to cancel my travel arrangements?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Please contact our customer care department on 020 7725 7000 for assistance if you wish to cancel any bookings for flight, accommodation, car hire etc. Please note that all cancellations involve certain charges to be borne by the traveller. These charges vary according to the nature of the booking and are adjusted against any refund that you receive. You will need your booking reference/s and any other relevant details at the time of cancellation. If you have arranged insurance to cover your travel and your reason for cancellation falls within the terms and conditions of such insurance, it may be possible to reclaim some or all losses incurred through your insurance company.
            </p>
            <h6>
                <strong>How do I make the payment? Are there any surcharges?</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                The balance on your booking is due 8 weeks prior to departure (unless stated otherwise). It can be paid in a number of ways: Phone - All payments can be made over the phone and your Personal Travel Consultant will be happy to help you. Please note that payments made by credit card, Amex and debit cards will incur no surcharge. Cheque - Please make all cheques payable to Citiamex Ltd, and post to the address stated on your invoice. If sending a cheque, please post early enough to allow time for the amount to clear. Bank Transfer - Please ask your consultant for our account details if you wish to complete an online bank transfer. Get A Flight requires payment to be made in full if travelling within 8 weeks. As long as the full balance is paid by the due date, payments in instalments may be made. Get A Flight will not automatically take payments using any card details provided and require verbal authorisation directly from the cardholder before a payment is taken. The balance due date will appear on every confirmation and invoice you receive, please note that we do not send any additional payment reminders.
