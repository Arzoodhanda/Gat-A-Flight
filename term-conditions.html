                Packages that we organise: where we combine and sell two or more different types of travel services to you for the purpose of the same trip or holiday, such as a flight and hotel, or hotel and car hire, so as to create a package holiday, your contract(s) will be with the supplier(s) or principal(s) on behalf of who we act as agent, but we will accept responsibility for performance of those contracts as a package organiser in accordance with the Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations 2018 (“Package Travel Regulations”) and arrange financial protection for your package. Section B sets out the terms and conditions that will apply in addition to Section A, when you book a package that we organise.<br>

Note: if after selecting and paying for one travel service, you then book additional travel services for your trip or holiday via our company, you will NOT benefit from the rights applying to packages under the Package Travel Regulations and we will not be responsible for the performance of individual travel services.<br>

Packages organised by a third party: Please note that occasionally we sell a package organised by a tour operator/principal acting as their agent. In that event, the tour operator/principal is responsible to you for your package and your financial protection and we act only as agent. Section A applies to all such bookings. Where a flight is included in the tour operator/principal’s package, the package will be protected by their ATOL and the ATOL holder’s name and ATOL number will be detailed in your booking confirmation.<br>

                Where we combine and sell to you two or more of the travel services specified below for the purpose of the same trip or holiday, this will comprise a “Package” and we will take responsibility for the package as an “organiser” under the Package Travel Regulations as long as those travel services are: purchased together from a single visit to our website and selected by you before you agree to pay; or advertised, sold or charged by us at an inclusive or total price; or advertised or sold under the term “package” or a similar term. A summary of our responsibilities as organiser is outlined in Section B of these Booking Conditions.<br>

Note: Where we are the organiser under the Package Travel Regulations, we will still act as agent in relation to the travel services and you will have contracts with each of the suppliers of those travel services. The travel services, two or more of which can constitute a Package, are:<br>

• a. transport (e.g. flight);<br>

• b. accommodation;<br>

• c. rental of cars or other motor vehicles;<br>

• d. any other tourist service not intrinsically part of one of the travel services in a. b. and c

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Please note that where you have made a booking which consists of either accommodation, transport or car rental, 
                plus one or more “other tourist services” as described at (d) above, according to the Package Travel Regulations
                 this will only create a Package where the tourist services account for 25% or more of the value of the combined
                  services or are advertised as, or otherwise represent, an essential feature of the Package.<br>

Additional tourist services selected and purchased after the transport, accommodation or car rental service has started or where the tourist services are intrinsically part of the other components will not make a Package. These bookings will be treated as single component bookings and will not provide rights under the Package Travel Regulations.

                <strong>BOOKING</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Bookings may be made online on our website www.getaflight.co.uk, or by telephone on 020 7725 7000 or in person at our agency premises. All bookings are subject to availability at the time of booking. We do not guarantee that any of the travel services that we advertise, including on our website, will still be available at the time of booking and once you have made a booking request, we will confirm availability of your chosen travel services to you.<br>

                Where you book online, the order summary email sent to you is NOT contractual acceptance of the supplier’s ability to provide these travel services, it is an acknowledgement that we have received your offer, and should the travel services be available as detailed on our website then we will issue to you a booking confirmation which is when your contract with us comes into existence and you have entered into a legally binding agreement to purchase those travel arrangements subject to the supplier’s terms and conditions and these Booking Conditions.<br>
                
                It is your responsibility to ensure that all names listed in the booking confirmation are accurate as per the passports of the travellers in your party and that the travel itinerary accords with your requirements. Changes are rarely possible once flight tickets and other travel documents are issued, and alterations may incur additional charges.<br>
                
                On receipt of all travel documents please check whether the details such as names, dates and timings are accurate and advise us immediately if there are any errors or omissions. Also, please note that all flight tickets or any product supplied are non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable unless otherwise stated.
            </p>

                <strong>FLIGHT BOOKINGS</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Financial protection: When you buy an ATOL protected flight from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. You will be advised at the time of booking whether your flight is ATOL protected and if your flight is protected you will be issued with an ATOL certificate.<br>

Not all of our flights are ATOL protected: some flight only sales are sold by us as agent for the airline.

Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance: Scheduled Airline Failure Insurance (or SAFI) can be purchased at your option at an additional cost to protect your payments in the event of airline failure. Please ask to see the terms of the SAFI policy for precise details of what is covered.<br>

Availability: Seat availability and pricing is at the airline’s discretion. Flight times shown are provisional and may be subject to change, as per the airline’s booking conditions. Most airlines stipulate that bookings are non-refundable.<br>

Fares: Airfares can increase quickly after initial quotation and so please make payment within 1 hour of your booking having been confirmed in order to guarantee the fare offered. If your fare has changed by the time you make payment, you will have a right to cancel and claim a full refund if you do not want to proceed with the booking.<br>

Indirect flights: Please note that some flights may be indirect and fly via other airports. Where an indirect flight is offered, full details of any flight stopovers will be made clear to you at the time of booking.<br>

Baggage allowance: The free baggage allowance offered to the passenger differs significantly from airline and airline and depending on the route. Our prices include the standard baggage allowance allowed by the airline. The allowance you are entitled to will be shown in the booking conditions of your airline. Some airlines may allow additional luggage to be added after the booking – this depends on the terms and conditions of the individual airline to which you should refer.<br>

Certain airlines consider hold luggage to be an optional extra. When you are booking with an airline that does make a charge for hold luggage, it is not included or displayed in our headline prices and the option to add this extra facility will be offered to you at the time of booking. Should you choose not to take any hold luggage on your trip then you will receive the standard hand luggage allowance as detailed in the airlines booking conditions which is normally between 5 and 10kgs but please check your booking confirmation which will specify the hand luggage allowance. Bags must be no larger than the dimensions allowed by the airline in question for carry-on luggage. For further information please refer to the airline booking conditions. Please note many countries including the UK have importing food, plant and animal products. You should ensure that you do not carry any restricted items.<br>

Check-in: Check-in procedures are included in the booking confirmation email we send to you. Some airlines will require this check-in to be carried out online; where this is required, failure to check-in online will result in check-in fees at the airport which you will be liable to pay for. It is your sole responsibility to follow the airline’s check-in procedures and to check-in in good time for your flight. To allow adequate time for security and check-in procedures, we recommend that you arrive at the airport 3 hours before your departure time. Check-in counters generally close 60 minutes prior to departure.<br>

No-Show: In Case of No-Show, alternate options will be available as per the Airlines policy.<br>

Amendment and cancellation: Most flight bookings are non-refundable by the airline and any amendment or cancellation will incur charges. See the individual airline’s booking conditions. As we are your booking agent, please contact us in the event of any amendment or cancellation.

                <strong>PRICE AND PAYMENT</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                The price of your holiday includes all taxes and additional fees, charges and costs that are known at the time of your booking. Where such additional taxes, fees charges and costs cannot be calculated prior to you making a booking you will be given an indication of the type of additional costs that you may still have to bear.<br>

                In order to book your chosen travel arrangements, you will be required to pay an instalment/deposit on account of the full price or the full balance at the time of booking depending on when you make your booking relative to the travel departure date. You must also pay any applicable insurance premiums and booking fees.<br>
                
                If only a part payment is made, the balance must be paid on or before the due date that we stipulate in your booking confirmation. Failing to do so may result in cancellation of the booking by the principal(s) or supplier(s) and may incur cancellation fees set out in their terms and conditions.<br><br>
                
                Note: Except where otherwise advised or stated in the terms and conditions of the supplier concerned, all monies you pay to us for travel arrangements will be held on behalf of the supplier/principal concerned, with the exception of bookings protected by an ATOL. Any money paid to us in respect of a booking protected by an ATOL is held by us on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust at all times, but subject to our obligation to pay it to the ATOL holder for so long as the ATOL holder does not fail financially. If the ATOL holder does fail financially, any money held at that time by us or subsequently accepted from the consumer by us, is and continues to be held by us on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust without any obligation to pay that money to the ATOL holder.

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                We strongly recommend that you take out sufficient travel insurance in order to cover you and your party and many of the principals or suppliers of the travel services that we sell require you to do so as a condition of booking with them. In addition, certain destinations have made it compulsory to take out travel Insurance – we will advise you where insurance is compulsory. We recommend that your insurance policy covers you, as a minimum, against the cost of cancellation by you; the cost of medical assistance (including repatriation) in the event of accident or illness; loss of baggage and money; and other expenses.<br><br>

We can arrange travel insurance on your behalf with Globalshield International Limited trading as Holidayrisk (“Holidayrisk”) – please see our website for further details. We act as appointed representative of Holidayrisk who is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (firm Reference Number 308028). Holidayrisk travel policies are underwritten by Travel Insurance Facilities Group (TIF) and insured by Union Reiseversicherung AG (URV). Please check all insurance documentation carefully to ensure that all the details are correct, and that all relevant information has been provided by you. Failing to do so may affect the validity of the insurance cover.

In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier can do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree 
                 to accept that in those circumstances, the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).<br><br>
                
                If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through
                 an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer
                  a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees
                   any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, 
                   the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body,
                    if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.<br><br>

                 at the time of making your booking if you or someone in your party is pregnant (or becomes pregnant before departure) so that we

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                If we have organised a Package for you, you have the right to cancel your Package before departure without paying a cancellation charge in the event of Unavoidable and Extraordinary Circumstances occurring at your holiday destination or its immediate vicinity and significantly affecting the performance of the Package or significantly affecting transport to the destination. In these circumstances, we shall provide you with a full refund of the monies you have paid but we will not be liable to pay you any compensation. Please note that your right to cancel in these circumstances will only apply where the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against travel to your destination or its immediate vicinity.

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                If the supplier makes an insignificant change to your travel arrangements, we will make reasonable efforts to inform you as soon
                 as reasonably possible if there is time before your departure, but we will have no liability to you. Examples of insignificant 
                 changes include alteration of your outward/return flights by less than 24 hours, changes to aircraft type, change of accommodation
                  to another of the same or higher standard, changes of carriers or minor changes to services available at the hotel. Please note
                   that carriers such as airlines may be subject to change.<br><br>

                Occasionally the supplier/principal may have to make a significant change to your confirmed travel arrangements. Examples of
                 “significant changes” include the following, when made before departure:<br><br>
                
                • A change of accommodation area for the whole or a significant part of your time away<br><br>
                
                • A change of accommodation to that of a lower standard or classification for the whole or a significant part of your time away.<br><br>
                
                • A change of outward departure time or overall length of your travel arrangements by more than 12 hours.<br><br>
                
                • A change of UK departure airport except between:<br><br>
                
                • A significant change to your itinerary, missing out one or more destination entirely.<br><br>
                
                If the supplier/principal has to make a significant change or cancel your travel arrangements, we will tell you as soon as possible
                 and if there is time to do so before departure, we will offer you the choice of:<br><br>
                
                • i. accepting the changed travel arrangements; or<br><br>
                
                • ii. having a refund of all monies paid; or<br><br>
                
                • iii. accepting an offer of alternative travel arrangements of comparable or higher standard if available (at no extra cost); or<br><br>
                
                • iv. if available, accepting an offer of alternative travel arrangements of a lower standard, with a refund of the price difference
                 between the original travel arrangements and the alternative travel arrangements<br><br>
                
                You must notify us of your choice as soon as possible and within the period of time that we give you for acceptance. If we do not hear
                 from you within that time period, we will contact you again to request notification of your choice. If you fail to respond again we
                  may treat the booking as terminated and refund your payment of the effected component.<br><br>
                
                If you choose to cancel following notification of a significant change, we will provide a full refund of any travel insurance premiums
                 paid to us if you are unable to transfer or reuse your policy.

                <strong>OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS ORGANISER FOR PACKAGES</strong>
            </h6>
            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Liability as organiser: Where you have booked a package where we are acting as organiser under the Package Travel Regulations,
                 although we still act as agent for the supplier/principals of your chosen travel arrangements and your contracts will be with
                  the supplier/principals, we will accept responsibility for the travel arrangements making up your package as an “organiser”
                   under the Package Travel Regulations as set out below. As such, we are responsible to properly provide all of the travel
                    services included in your Package, as set out in your booking confirmation. Subject to these Booking Conditions, if we
                     (or the supplier/principals) have failed to perform or has improperly performed those travel arrangements and we don’t
                      remedy or resolve your complaint within a reasonable period of time and this has affected the enjoyment of your Package,
                       you may be entitled to an appropriate price reduction or compensation or both. The level of such compensation will be 
                       calculated taking into consideration all relevant factors such as (but not limited to): you having followed the complaints
                        procedure as described in these Booking Conditions and the extent to which ours or our employees’ or the supplier/principal’s
                         negligence affected the overall enjoyment of your Package. Please note that it is your responsibility to show that we or the
                          Supplier/Principals have failed to perform or improperly performed your Package if you wish to make a claim against us.<br><br>

We will not be responsible or pay you any compensation for any injury, illness, death, loss, damage, expense, cost or other claim of any description
 if (and to the extent that) it results from:<br><br>

an act(s) and/or omission(s) of the person(s) affected; or<br><br>

an act(s) and/or omission(s) of a third party unconnected with the provision of the services forming part of your Package and which were unavoidable
 and extraordinary; or<br><br>

due to Unavoidable and Extraordinary circumstances.<br><br>

Limits on liability: If we are found liable under the Package Travel Regulations, we will limit the amount of compensation we may have to pay you as
 follows:<br><br>

Claims which don’t involve injury, illness or death. The maximum amount we will have to pay you in respect of these claims is up to three times the 
price paid by or on behalf of the person(s) affected in total. This maximum amount will only be payable where everything has gone wrong and you or
 your party has not received any benefit at all from your booking.<br><br>

Claims in respect of international travel by air, sea and rail, or any stay in a hotel<br><br>

The extent of our liability will in all cases be limited as if we were carriers under the applicable international conventions, which include
 The Warsaw/Montreal Convention (international travel by air); The Athens Convention (with respect to sea travel); The Berne/Cotif Convention
  (with respect to rail travel) and The Paris Convention (with respect to hotel accommodation). You can ask for copies of these Conventions from
   our offices.<br><br>

In addition, you agree that the operating carrier or transport company's own "Conditions of Carriage" will apply to you on that journey. When
 arranging transportation for you, we rely on the terms and conditions contained within these international conventions and those "Conditions
  of Carriage". You acknowledge that all of the terms and conditions contained in those "Conditions of Carriage" form part of your Package booking
   with us, as well as with the transport company and that those "Conditions of Carriage" shall be deemed to be included by reference into this
    Package booking.<br><br>

In any circumstances in which an airline is liable to you by virtue of the EC Regulation 261/2004 (regarding denied boarding, cancellations and long
 delays), any liability we may have to you arising out of your Package booking, arising out of the same facts, is limited to the remedies provided
  under the Regulation as if (for this purpose only) we were a carrier.<br><br>

When making any payment, we are entitled to deduct any money which you have received or are entitled to receive from the transport provider or 
hotelier for the complaint or claim in question.<br><br>

It is a condition of our acceptance of liability under these regulations that you notify any claim to ourselves and our Supplier/Principal(s)
 strictly in accordance with the complaints procedure set out in these conditions.<br><br>

Where any payment is made, the person(s) receiving it (and their parent or guardian if under 18 years) must also assign to ourselves or our insurers
 any rights they may have to pursue any third party and must provide ourselves and our insurers with all assistance we may reasonably require.<br><br>

Please note, we do not accept any liability for any damage, loss or expense or other sum(s) of any description: (a) which, on the basis of the 
information given to us by you concerning your booking prior to our accepting it, we could not have foreseen you would suffer or incur; or (b)
 which relates to any business.<br><br>

We do not accept responsibility for services or facilities which were not included on your booking confirmation or where they are not advertised
 in our brochure / on our website. For example any excursion you book whilst away, or any service or facility which your hotel or any other supplier
  agrees to provide for you.<br><br>

Where it is impossible for you to return safely to your departure point as per the agreed return date of your Package, due to Unavoidable and
 Extraordinary Circumstances, we shall provide you with any necessary accommodation (where possible, of a comparable standard) for a period not
  exceeding three nights per person. Please note that the 3-night cap does not apply to persons with reduced mobility, pregnant women or unaccompanied
   minors, nor to persons needing specific medical assistance, provided we have been notified of these particular needs at least 48 hours before
    the start of your Package.

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                Flight Packages: We provide financial protection for all our flight packages by way of our ATOL number 10336, issued by the Civil Aviation
                 Authority, Gatwick Airport South, West Sussex, RH6 0YR, UK, telephone 0333 103 6350, email claims@caa.co.uk. When you buy a flight inclusive
                  Package from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this
                   means for you and who to contact if things go wrong. For further information, visit the ATOL website at www.atol.org.uk. The price of our
                    flight inclusive arrangements includes the amount of £2.50 per person as part of the ATOL Protection Contribution (APC) we pay to the CAA.
                     This charge is included in our advertised prices. Not all holiday or travel services offered and sold by us will be protected by the ATOL
                      Scheme. ATOL protection extends primarily to customers who book and pay in the United Kingdom.<br><br>

                We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable
                 alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may
                  provide you with the services you have bought (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL
                   holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL
                    holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be 
                    entitled to make a claim under the ATOL Scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).<br><br>
                
                If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an
                 alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit
                  on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claims which
                   you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent
                    (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body
                     has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.<br><br>
                
                Non-flight Packages: We provide financial security for Packages not including flights by way of our bond held with ABTA Ltd, The Travel Association 30 Park Street London SE1 9EQ www.abta.co.uk.
                
                If you book travel arrangements that don’t form part of a Package e.g you book and pay for single travel services (even if you add other services later) your monies may not be financially protected. Please ask us for further details.

            <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px;">
                If you have booked a Package and whilst you are on holiday, you find yourself in difficulty for any reason we will offer you such
                 prompt assistance as is appropriate in the circumstances. In particular, we will provide you with appropriate information on health
                  services, local authorities and consular assistance, and with distance communications and finding alternative travel arrangements.
                   Where you require assistance that is not due to any failure by us, our employees or sub-contractors, we will not be liable for the
                    costs of any alternative travel arrangements or other such assistance you require. Any supplier/principal, airline or other
                     transport supplier may however pay for or provide refreshments and/or appropriate accommodation and you should make a claim 
                     directly to them. Subject to the other terms of these Booking Conditions, we will not be liable for any costs, fees or charges
                      you incur in the above circumstances, if you fail to obtain our prior authorisation before making your own travel arrangements.
                       Furthermore, we reserve the right to charge you a fee for our assistance in the event that the difficulty is caused
                        intentionally by you or a member of your party, or otherwise through you or your party’s negligence.
